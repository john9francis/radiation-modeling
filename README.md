# Overview

One effective way of treating cancer tumors in hospitals is radiation treatments. There are many methods of radiation treatment including using linear accelerator (LINAC) machines. These machines deliver radiation through X-Rays or electrons, shooting them into the body to annihilate the tumor. Collateral damage to other organs is minimized as the machine rotates around the patient, so that all the radiation goes through the tumor but only portions go through the outer layers of skin.

This project aims to computationally model a radiation treatment using the LINAC machine. I will be conducting research to learn exactly how this machine works and delivers the radiation. Then, I will model how much damage will be affecting each layer of the body as the dosage is delivered. Finally, I will compare a couple of different methods of delivering the dosage (X-Rays, electrons, protons, etc.) and conclude which method causes the least amount of damage to surrounding areas of the body. 

# Development Environment

The code for this project will primarily be written in Python using Visual Studio Code. The libraries I will be using are NumPy, MatPlotLib, and SymPy. 

# Project Goals

- Model what a LINAC does in a one dimensional context
- Model a person and model how the accelerator affects each region of the body, neglecting attenuation of the particle/ray going through the body
- Compare and contrast different methods of Linear Acceleration (X-ray, electron, proton)
- Add attenuation to the mix and conclude how much dosage each layer of the body will recieve
