# Overview

One effective way of treating cancer tumors in hospitals is radiation treatments. There are many methods of radiation treatment including using linear accelerator (LINAC) machines. These machines deliver radiation through X-Rays, shooting them into the body to annihilate the tumor. Collateral damage to other organs is minimized as the machine rotates around the patient, so that all the radiation goes through the tumor but only portions go through the body's outer layers.

This project aims to computationally model a radiation treatment using the LINAC machine. I will be conducting research to learn exactly how this machine works and delivers the radiation. Then, I will model how much damage will be affecting each layer of the body as the dosage is delivered, as well as how much dose was delivered to the tumor.

# Development Environment

The code for this project will primarily be written in Python using Visual Studio Code. The libraries I will be using are found in the requirements.txt file. To run this project on your own machine, clone the repository and then you can run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and it will automatically install all the libraries that I have used.
