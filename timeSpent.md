# Time Spent:

This file is a record of the time I have spent on this project. 

Started: 5/22/2023

# Long term goals:

- 400 total hours
- 16 weeks before school starts
- 14 weeks of the semester
- ~ 14 hours a week 
- or 20 hours a week until school starts and 6 hours a week when school is in session

# Week 1: 5/22-5/28

Goals: 20 hours

- [X] Come up with some research papers to read and learn more about medical radiation procedures
- [x] Set up GitHub repository
- [x] Make a Python virtual environment
- [ ] Make a plan for the project

- 5/22 9:00 pm 2 hrs Working on setting up GitHub and coming up with time periods for the project, setting up virtual environment. 
- 5/23 5:50 pm 1 hr Research medical equipment websites to see which tools they use and researched how they work
- 5/24 7:15 pm 1.5 hrs Researched how the LINAC works (it's just a high energy x-ray beam) and looked into how proton therapy works. Also got about 4 research papers collected to read
- 5/25 3:45 pm 2 hrs Things I got done: 1. Learned about units: Grays are units of "dose" which is the damage done by the photon beam. 2. I compiled a bunch of graphs and papers about dose from an x-ray photon beam. 3. I wrote a short paper summarizing my goals for this project. 
- 5/26 9:30 am 1 hr looked through about 5 research papers. I have been seeing the PDD (percentage depth dose) vs. depth graph a lot. Next thing to do is really understand what this graph is saying.
