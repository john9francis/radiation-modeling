# Project plan:
# Long term goals:

- 400 total hours
- 30 weeks
- 12.5 hours a week

# Project plan 1: (6/22)
### Phase 1 plan (10 weeks):
- Create a model of a stationary x-ray LINAC and the radiation activity at different distances, amounts of time, and voltages.
- Implement a method to convert that activity into exposure

### Phase 1 reality:

### Phase 2 (10 weeks): 
- Create a model of a person (for now, just one circular cross-section) with a tumor in the center
- Modify the linac model to be able to rotate around the person 
- Record the exposure in each layer of the body
### Phase 3 (10 weeks):
- Add attenuation to the model. The beam will lose energy as it passes through layers.

### Further work (the rest of the time): 
- Add functionality for the tumor to be anywhere in the cross-section, not just the center.
- Make the person model a bit more realistic. Mark out the cross section with organs, bones, etc.
- Implement a method to convert the exposure into effective dose. Record the effective dose in each of the different organs.
- Repeat everything with proton therapy instead of x-ray therapy
