# Week 1 Lab Report

Author: John Francis 

Group: John Francis and Scott Ward

# Procedure
Each in our group measured the following 4 different systems: 
1. The length of a tube that resonated at 295.3 Hz at a temperature of 21.5 $^oC$
2. The length of a tube that resonated at 295.3 Hz at a temperature of -5.5 $^oC$
3. The number of times a purple bead was pulled out of a jar when tried 5 times
4. The number of radiation events detected in one min

# Summary
In this lab we took measurements involving a tube with an adjustable length and tuning fork, both indoor temperature and outdoor. We also recorded the color of bead we pulled out of a jar whether it was white or purple. We measure the number of clicks in a minute that a Geiger counter in a fixed location had. Some of the difficulties included making sure the equipment was at the right temperature and uncertainty in who was using the equipment before us. We were able to compute the statistics fairly easily. There are different types of standard deviations that we found were computable. There was some uncertainty in our measurements but with the beads there was no uncertainty in the color. We also assumed the Geiger counter was accurate with the result it showed at the one-minute mark. The result didn't vary around the one-minute result so there was no uncertainty other than machine error. If we did this again we would want to make sure of the temperature of the tuning fork before hand and ensure the group before us did not have the tuning fork outside.
