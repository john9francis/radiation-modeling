# Time spent phase 3

Goal:
- Create a 1D Linac beam model, with graphs of PDD
- Discuss accuracy with other people's research

- [Week 1](#week-1-1030-115)

# Week 1: 10/30-11/5
Goals:
- [ ] Put out G4 Brems v060 vid
- [ ] Prove the accuracy of G4-Brems using the claimed bremsstrahlung process in the g4 documentation, for the cross sections. Basically I need to analytically make the graph using mathematica or something
- [ ] Make the g4-linac beam video
- [ ] Make documentation for g4-brems

- 10/30 1:00 pm .25 hr running a test on G4-Brems, and emailing professors
- 10/30 5:20 pm 1.25 hr planning phase 3 and looking at the geant4 claimed bremsstrahlung spectrum, trying to graph their analytical data.
- 10/31 9:16 am .5 hr looking at the g4-app video I started, and prepping for g4-medical-linac
- 10/31 10:40 am 1.25 hr recording the beginnings of g4-medical-linac
- 10/31 3:00 pm 1.5 hr prepping and talking to brother kelley about next steps, also messing with g4-brems more
- 11/2 4:50 pm 2.25 hr working on g4 med linac and learning about geant4 with python. UPDATE: I almost got g4 med linac going but there's a bug with the visualization
- 11/2 9:39 pm 2 hr trying to see if I can get geant4 with python. UPDATE: I'm almost done with the whole basic program in python
